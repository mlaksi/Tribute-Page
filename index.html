                Borislav Pekic (4 February 1930 – 2 July 1992) was a Serbian and Yugoslav writer and political activist. He was born in 1930, to a prominent family in Montenegro, at that time part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. From 1945 until his emigration to London
                in 1971, he lived in Belgrade. He was also one of the founding members of the Democratic Party in Serbia. He is considered one of the most important Serbian literary figures of the 20th century. </p>
            <p class="tribute-txt">For years Pekic had been working on several novels and when the first of them, <cite>Vreme cuda</cite> (1965), came out, it caught the attention of a wide reading audience as well as the critics. In 1976 it was published in English by Brace
                Harcourt in New York as <cite>The
            Time of Miracles</cite>. It was also translated into French in 1986, Polish in 1986, Romanian in 1987, Italian in 2004, and Greek in 2007. Pekic's first novel clearly announced two of the most important characteristics of his work: sharp anti-dogmatism
                and constant skepticism regarding any possible 'progress' mankind has achieved over the course of history.</p>
            <p class="tribute-txt"> In 1970 his second novel, <cite>Hodocasce Arsenija Njegovana</cite> (<cite>The Pilgrimage of Arsenije Njegovan</cite>) was published, in which an echo of the students protests of 1968 in Yugoslavia can be found. Despite his ideological distance
                from the mainstream opposition movements, the new political climate further complicated his relationship with the authorities, who refused him a passport for some time. The novel, nevertheless, won the NIN award for the best Yugoslav novel
                of the year. An English translation The Houses of Belgrade appeared in 1978 and it was later published in Polish, Czech and Romanian.
